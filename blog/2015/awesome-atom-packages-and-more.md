## Awesome Atom Packages

- Color
  - [Pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments) displays colors for css, less and sass, offering many other handy color utilities as well. (Better checkout its setting and configure the supported filetypes, or you may get color words in your markdown rendered...)
  - [Color-picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker): an awesome color picker.
- Format
  - [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
- Comfortable Coding
  - [Highlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected) highlights all occurrence of current selected word. (Just like Sublime.)
  - [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) speeds up HTML developing.
- Collaboration
  - [Atom-pair](https://atom.io/packages/atom-pair): remote collaboration on a same tab.
- Stat
  - [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/) automatically measures coding time.

## Handy Command-line Tools and Libraries

- Text Processing
  - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
  - [Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) the Silver Searcher, a code searching tool similar to ack, with a focus on speed.
- Linting
  - [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), the pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX.
  - [JSCS](http://jscs.info/), a code style linter.

> BTW, I do not recommend linter packages (e.g. [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint)) because I think we should rarely break the rules we defined ourselves. Using command-line linters is just an insurance.

## Something More

- [Advanced-new-file](https://atom.io/packages/advanced-new-file) and [Advanced-open-file](https://atom.io/packages/advanced-open-file): I prefer `atom some/existing/file/or/new/file` through command-line, but you may like them.
- [Toggle-quotes](https://atom.io/packages/toggle-quotes): It's very useful for me...... It even auto changes `'"'` to `"\""`......
- [Travis-CI-Status](https://atom.io/packages/travis-ci-status): In most case I use pre-commit hooks to avoid pushing untested code, so I don't need a package to remind me of my Travis status. But you may like this.
- [Save-session](https://atom.io/packages/save-session): for Atom 1.1.0, unsaved changes in named tabs survive a `Don't save` close, but unnamed tabs fail. You may need this.
- [Imdone-Atom](https://atom.io/packages/imdone-atom): A task-board for TODOs, FIXMEs, HACKs, etc in your code.
- [Merge-conflicts](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts): To be honest, I haven't met conflicts for some time... But this seems cool.
- [File-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons): Assign file extension icons and colours for improved visual grepping.
